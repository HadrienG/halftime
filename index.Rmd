<div id="intro-text-box">Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystem on the planet.</div><br>
<div id="intro-text-box" class="fragment fade-left">They face great challenges and their population is rapidely declining.</div><br>
<div id="intro-text-box" class="fragment fade-left">Can research help?</div>

## Where? {#map data-background="assets/img/map_cropped.png"}

  
## What?

- Monitor the health of coral reefs using bacterial communities
- Characterize the relationship between corals and their microbial environment

## Why?

- Bacterial communities relatively understudied
- We do not know what are their role in the ecosystem
- Beneficial Microorganisms for corals (BMCs)

## Which one works best?

No **independant**, **comprehensive** and **extensible** benchmarks of taxonomic classifiers exists yet

# Applying WMS to coral reef communities

## Surrounding the reef

Ultra-deep sequencing of sediment and water samples in close proximity of coral reefs

## {data-background="assets/img/dive.svg"}

## Surrounding the reef

- 6 sampling sites
- water and sediment samples
- NovaSeq sequencing (~ 300G / sample)

## 300G? {#nonpareil}

## A dive in the coral reef microbiome

- 10 sampling sites
- mucus samples
- DNA and RNA sequencing
